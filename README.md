# Swift/Combine Users Api Service Example

Simple Swift Combine program to retrieve data from the jsonplaceholder api and display it to the screen. Makes a call to: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users, breaks the data down into users and posts, then displays each user in a navigation view with their posts on the next screen.

Additionally has functionality to test POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE using either Async/Await or Combine/Future calls.
